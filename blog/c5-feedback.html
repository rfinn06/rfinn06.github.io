  <p>Pair programming was something that really scared me coming in to Dev Bootcamp.  I was anxious about being judged by my pair or not being able to hold my own.  Overall my experience with pair programming has been positive.  I have come to view pair programming as a fun challenge and an opportunity to teach and learn new things.  Pairing has also opened my eyes to different perspectives on how to tackle challenges.  Pairing has been rewarding, but that doesn't mean it's not without it challenges.</p>
  <p>For me the most challenging part has been speaking up and sharing my ideas.  This is becuase I lack confidence in ideas and don't want to be wrong.  I need to realzie that even if my ideas are wrong or they are not the correct solution for a particular problem, I should stil voice them.  Doing so might open my pair's eyes to a new way of looking at something and allow them to educate meet.  Sharing will benefit and not sharing doesn't do anything.</p>
  <p>After we pair with a partner we receive feedback from them.  Overall I have felt that the feedback I have received is fair.  My pairs have pointed out what I am doing well and what I need to work on.  Based on the feedback I have tried to work on respecting the driver navigator roles and being more vocal.  In proviing feedback to my pair the most difficult thing is providing constructive feedback while not being too harsh or sounding disrespectful.  I feel that I want to get that constructvie feedback so that I can get better, so that is the mindest I take when giving it to others.  Good feedback should be kind, actionable, and specific.  The point of providing feedback is to help, not put someone down.  The feedback should be specific so that the receiver knows exactly what you are talking about.  The feedback should also provide ways to imrpove or steps to take that will address any deficiency.</p>
  <p>Overall pairing and feedback have been a great resource for learning.  It is a great opportunity to teach, learn, and have fun.</p> <!-- Enter body of blog post here -->
