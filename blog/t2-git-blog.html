  <p>There are two different CSS selectors that can be used to save a developer time.  These two selectors are "Class" and "ID".  We will explore both of these in this article and give examples of when and how to use them.</p>
  <h2>Classes</h2>
    <p>A class can be used to grab a group of HTML tags and apply the same features to all of them in the group.  This is helpful for instance if we would like to apply the same text size and color to all h1 elements in our HTML file.  To do this, we would first need to tag all h1 elements in our HTML file using the following syntax:</p>
      <img src= />
    <p>
    <p>Now that you have all of your h1 elements identified you can now apply features to them using CSS.  In your CSS file, you will do this by using the following sytax:</p>
      <img src= />
    <p>All of your h1 elements will now have the same features.  This makes it quick and easy to apply the sames features to many elements at once.  It also makes it easier for making changes in the future too.</p>
    <p>What if we want to just apply changes to one set of h1 tags in our HTML file and not the others?  To do this you can use IDs.</p>
    <h2>IDs</h2>
    <p>Let's say we have two sets of h1 tags in our HTML file and want to make only one of the sets have bold text.  We can accomplish this by using an ID tag in our HTML file.  Use the following syntax to grab the h1 element you want to change:</p>
      <img src= />
    <p>Now that we have our h1 elements identified, we use the following syntax in CSS to apply the features we want to add.  In this case bold text:</p>
      <img src= />
    <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Classes can be used to apply features in CSS to a group of HTML elements saving time.</li>
        <li>IDs can be used to apply features in CSS to a specific HTML tag that will not change the other tags.</li>
