        After watching Shereef's firside chat and getting through the first week of Phase 0, here are my thoughts on the DBC experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is going to be my expericence and my education.  I must take ownership of it and not just consume it.  It is important to contribute to this experience by communicating with the other members of my cohort.  By sharing my thoughts, ideas, and knowledge with others I will not only be contributing but also learning how to be an affective communicator.  Also, by contributung as much as I can hopfully others will do the same and I will learn from them.  I am most excited about getting to know all of the memebers of my cohort and building cools things with them.

        My impressions from the first week so far is that each student will be really guiding themself through this experience.  That doesn't mean that we are on our own, there are plenty of resources to use for help and guidance. But we will have to be mindful of when to reach out for help or when to spend more time on a subject that we don't understand.  Also, I am starting to think that the students are not just students.  We are teachers too.  Teaching ourselves how to do new things and teaching others by trying to share knowledge and be helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        This type of learning style will definitely be challenging.  It will be important to have patience and understad that learning new things is hard.  It is also rewarding.  I know that I will stuggle at times with this type of environment, but I am going to embrace it and see it as a challenge.
