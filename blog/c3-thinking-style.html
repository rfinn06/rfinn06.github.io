  <p>Before starting at Dev Bootcamp, students must explore their thinking styles to gain a better understanding of how they learn. In order to do this, students must take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a> that will provide insight on their thinking style. After taking this quiz I learned that my thinking style is predominately Concrete Sequential. These thinking styles were developed by <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Anthony F. Gregorc, Ph. D.</a></p>

<p>As a Concrete Sequential learner, I learn best when I have a structured environment. I also process information in a sequential and logical order. At times, my learning and thinking styles have been in conflict with phase 0 at DBC. I'm not suggesting that phase 0 is unorganized or unstructured. However, the program is not a set up as a typical learning environment. We don't have lectures and tests. What we have is more of a self-guided learning curriculum. At times this has been challenging for me as I like being in a structured environment.</p>

<p>In order to help me adjust to this new learning style there are a couple of things I need to do. The first is creating my own structure within the program. I have been trying to create a routine every week that will allow me to feel more comfortable while I am learning. The other thing I have been trying to do is use learning strategies that I am weakest at. My theory is that if I practice using my weakest learning strategies, I will strengthen those muscles.</p>

<p>I think the best way to strengthen my weakest learning styles is to expose myself to new situations. Starting at DBC has done just that. I am in an environment that is not the most structured. Three weeks in and I feel like am starting to adapt more to the program. I need to continue to push myself outside my comfort zone though.  One of the things I was most worried about in starting DBC was pair programming.  With my learning style, I don't do best when working in a group.  By exposing myself to pair programming, I have become better at it and have come to enjoy it.  I see it as an opportunity to teach and learn new at the same time.</p> <!-- Enter body of blog post here -->
