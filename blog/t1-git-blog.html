      <h3>Version Control and Its Benefits<h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control is a a process of tracking changes made to a file.  You can track what has been changed and when.  You also have the ability to look back and see the previous versions you worked on.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two benefits that I see in using version control.  Everyone makes mistakes, I make a lot, so it is good to have a safety net so that you can go back to the last version of whatever you are working on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second benefit is that by looking at previous versions of your work you get insight into your thought process.  You can look back and see how things have evolved and remember why you did certain things.  Sometimes we ask ourselves 'Why did I do that?', well hopefully by looking back we can remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Git<h3>
    <p>
        Now that you have an understanding of what Version control is, you might be asking yourself, what tools are out there? Well, there is Git.  You can start your researh on Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is free!  Git is good!  After you download it to your local machine you can start tracking changes you make to files and other things like code.  So if you are runing Git and make changes to a file, you can ask Git whats going on.  Git will tell you what has been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are ok with your changes you can stage them and then commit.  Commit is a save or check point.  So if you keep working on your file and decide that you're not happy with what you have done, you can go back to your last commit or check point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>GitHub<h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub is not the same as Git.  Git is a local software that keeps track of changes you have made to your files.  GitHub is a remote service where you can store everything you are working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to think of using Git and GitHub in the context of building a house.  Let's say that you have a plumber, a carpetner, and an electrician all working on the same house.  Each of them needs to keep track of their work.  The electrician has to remember that he ran wire in a certain part of the house before he can install an outlet.  Using Git, the electician can look back and see if he did or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      So each of these workers has the ability to track their own work.  However, they also need a way to track what the others are doing.  The plumber does not want to install a sink above an electrical outlet.  That would just be bad, eh.  This is where GitHub comes in.  It is a central reposity where all three of these workes can push the work they have been doing to one location so they can all see each other's work.  So all of the features they have worked on individaully can be reviewed before they are merged into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Summary<h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      - Version control is a process to track work you are doing.
      - Git is a version control tool used on your local machine to track changes made to files.
      - GitHub is a place to push changes to a repository for a project you are working on.  This way you can track all parts of a project.
