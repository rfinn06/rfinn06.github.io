  <p>Diversity in the tech industry is definitely lacking.  Among some of the top tech companies in the U.S. 60% of the workforce is white and 71% is male.  On average blacks make up 7% of the work force for these top tech companies.  This data comes from an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/20/9179853/tech-diversity-scorecard-apple-google-microsoft-facebook-intel-twitter-amazon">article</a> on TheVerge.com that looked at the results of the Equal Employment Opportunity report.  The U.S. government requires that companies provide data on the gender and race of its workforce.  Some have argued that this report is flawed in that the categories used to classify employees on the report do not reflect the tech industries'.  In any case, diversity is still a concern among the tech industry and many leading companies have acknowledged this.</p>
  <p>Why is there such a diversity gap in the tech industry?  One of the most obvious answers would be lack of educational opportunity.  There is most likely some truth to this, but some suggest that the pipline issue is not the primary concern.  The primary concern is that the culture of these companies needs to change as they do not foster an environment for inclusion.</p>
  <p>Change must come from within.  I belive that if companies want to change their culture, they must educate their workforce on the benefits of diversity.  If you have a company culture that is mindful of these benefits, increasing diversity will become more of a priority.  The good news is that many companies are recognizing these benefits and are striving to make changes.</p>
