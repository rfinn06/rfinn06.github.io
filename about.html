  <h2>Personal Background</h2>
  <p>I grew up in the south suburbs of Chicago and feel that I am a midwesterner through and through.  In my mind, being a midwesterner means that you are welcoming, hardworking, and always willing to lend a helping hand.  These are values that are important to me and I try to uphold them to the best of my ability.  I am proud to be from the midwest and feel that being so has made me the person I am today.</p>
  <h2>Educational Background</h2>
  <p>Growing up I was lucky enough to receive a Catholic education.  There are two reasons why I am thankful for the education I recieved.  The first is that the experience provided me with a strong sense of self.  I learned what was important to me and what my values are.  The second reason I am thankful for my Catholic education is that it instilled in me the importance of community.</p>
  <p>After high school I attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  This was the first time in my life I was going to be in a place where I didn't know anyone.  This was a great experience.  It was almost like having to re-introduce myself to the world.  I received a great education both in and outside of the classroom.</p>
  <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
  <p>One of my hobbies includes collecting vinyl records.  There are two things I love about listening to vinyl that you don't get from digital music.  The first thing I love is the sound of vinyl.  There is a texture to the sound that fills a room when you're listening to a record.  The other thing I love about vinyl is that it is a completely different listening experience than listening to music digitally.  When you are listening to music digitally, you tend to jump around a lot between songs and artists.  When you are doing this you are passively listening to the music.</p>
  <p>Listening to a vinyl record is a more immersive experience.  I liken it to spending time with a good book.  The relationship between yourself and the music becomes more personal and thought provoking.  I encourage you to sit down and listen to a record.</p> <!-- Enter body of blog post here -->
